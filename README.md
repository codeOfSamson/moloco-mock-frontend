# Moloco-mock-frontend
Moloco Ad Campaign Manager Frontend app, an interface for my mock-up Moloco Api:

Built with React + Typescript, Tailwind css and Vite.

This platform that allows you to:

Create and manage ad campaigns

Attach creative groups with creatives (videos)

Simulate campaign performance (impressions, clicks, conversions)

Analyze campaign results and track top-performing groups in a "Champion List"

#Prerequisites
-Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
-npm or yarn

#Steps to run:
( Make sure Backed is running first, see readme to setup and run https://github.com/codeOfSamson/moloco-mockAPI.)

1) Download zip or clone this repo and navigate to project folder in terminal or IDE.
Enter in terminal
2) run 'npm install'
3) run 'npm run dev'

4) Then open up your browser at : âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/

# A note on the features and the functionality:
 Since this is just a mock-up, my main goal was to display my ability to learn and apply new concepts. This is not meant to be a fully robust app. If it were, then here is an initial list of things I would add:
  - Build DB, instead of using in memory.
  - Have user profiles, with registration and login pages.
  - Workplace accouts for ad accounts to belong to larger organizations
  - Full CRUD functionality.
  - A more complete interface for Champions list, in order to add and remove to Groups and campaigns based on results.
  - Allow other types of creatives to be uploaded.
